This gives a positive answer to a question of A. P. Calderón from 1980. Earlier the result has been shown only for conductivities that are sufficiently smooth. In higher dimensions the problem remains open.},

abstract = {Abstract We consider the impedance tomography problem for anisotropic conductivities. Given a bounded region Ω in space, a diffeomorphism Ψ from Ω to itself which restricts to the identity on ∂ Ω, and a conductivity γ on Ω, it is easy to construct a new conductivity Ψ*γ which will produce the same voltage and current measurements on ∂ Ω. We prove the converse in two dimensions (i.e., if γ1 and γ2 produce the same boundary measurements, then γ1, = Ψ*γ2 for an appropriate Ψ) for conductivities which are near a constant.}

abstract="There has recently been considerable interest in the possibility, both theoretical and practical, of invisibility (or ``cloaking'') from observation by electromagnetic (EM) waves. Here, we prove invisibility with respect to solutions of the Helmholtz and Maxwell's equations, for several constructions of cloaking devices. The basic idea, as in the papers [GLU2, GLU3, Le, PSS1], is to use a singular transformation that pushes isotropic electromagnetic parameters forward into singular, anisotropic ones. We define the notion of finite energy solutions of the Helmholtz and Maxwell's equations for such singular electromagnetic parameters, and study the behavior of the solutions on the entire domain, including the cloaked region and its boundary. We show that, neglecting dispersion, the construction of [GLU3, PSS1] cloaks passive objects, i.e., those without internal currents, at all frequencies k. Due to the singularity of the metric, one needs to work with weak solutions. Analyzing the behavior of such solutions inside the cloaked region, we show that, depending on the chosen construction, there appear new ``hidden'' boundary conditions at the surface separating the cloaked and uncloaked regions. We also consider the effect on invisibility of active devices inside the cloaked region, interpreted as collections of sources and sinks or internal currents. When these conditions are overdetermined, as happens for Maxwell's equations, generic internal currents prevent the existence of finite energy solutions and invisibility is compromised.",

We describe here the first practical realization of such a cloak; in our demonstration, a copper cylinder was {\textquotedblleft}hidden{\textquotedblright} inside a cloak constructed according to the previous theoretical prescription. The cloak was constructed with the use of artificially structured metamaterials, designed for operation over a band of microwave frequencies. The cloak decreased scattering from the hidden object while at the same time reducing its shadow, so that the cloak and object combined began to resemble empty space.},

The algorithm is based on the global uniqueness proof of Nachman (1996 Ann. Math. 143 71–96) for the 2D inverse conductivity problem. Results are shown for reconstructions from data collected on electrodes placed around the circumference of a human chest to reconstruct a 2D cross-section of the torso. The images show changes in conductivity during a cardiac cycle.}
